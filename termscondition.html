                                             retailers. Once your transaction is successfully tracked and verified by
                                             the retailer, we get a commission from the retailer and we pass on this

                                             may not get tracked or qualify for a cashback. Under any circumstances, we
                                             cannot be held responsible for the same. Retailers deem a transaction to be
                                             genuine or valid through their own set of rules. A transaction deemed as
                                             non-genuine or invalid by the retailer would not qualify for a cashback.
